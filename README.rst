Django-password-reset-mandrill
=====================
Forked from https://travis-ci.org/brutasse/django-password-reset.
This fork empowers django-password-reset to use Mandrill to send emails.  
It is assumed that https://github.com/brack3t/Djrill (Djrill) is installed to replace
standard Django email functionality with Mandrill transactional emails.

All instructions and features of django-password-reset still apply.

Class-based views for password reset, the usual "forget password?" workflow:

* User fills his email address or username
* Django sends him an email with a token to reset his password
* User chooses a new password

The token is not stored server-side, it is generated using Django's signing
functionality.
